## Step 2 

### Create a RMarkdown project through "Version Control" (paste the link; you need to set up Git in RMarkdown in advance.). It will generate a "XX.Rproj" file and a ".gitignore" file.

## Step 3

### Google "Bookdown-demo" and get the link to Github. Download all the files (You can type the address shown in the following pic as well.). Paste all the files into the same folder that contains the "XX.Rproj" file and the ".gitignore" file. However, you do not want to replace these two files.
